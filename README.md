# BayesMultiLogit
BayesMultiLogit

This is a package developed by Kyle R. McEvoy and Jared Fisher to implement a number of methods for performing Bayesian multinomial logistic
regression using data-augmentation methods.

The code for all functions using the Holmes-Held methods were written by us following the pseudo-code template provided in the paper:
"Bayesian Auxiliary Variable Models for Binary and Multinomial Regression" by Chris C. Holmes and Leonhard Held, Bayesian Analysis (2006).

The code for the Polya-Gamma functions was copied from the public repository https://github.com/jwindle/BayesLogit-Thesis. This repository
includes code written by Jesse Windle as part of their thesis.

The multivariate normal density function was copied from work by Nino Hardt, Dicko Ahmadou, Benjamin Christoffersen on the Rcpp Gallery
located at https://gallery.rcpp.org/articles/dmvnorm_arma/.
