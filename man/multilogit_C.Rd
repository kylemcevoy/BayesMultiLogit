\usage{
multilogit_C(
  Y,
  X,
  n_sample = 1000L,
  n_burn = 200L,
  n_sigma_check = 20L,
  prior = "flat",
  step_size = 0.1,
  prior_mean = NULL,
  prior_var = NULL,
  reference_cat = NULL,
  probs = TRUE,
  progress = TRUE
)
}
\arguments{
\item{Y}{An N by C numeric matrix where the ith row is a set of
indicators for observation i of N total observations giving which
of the C categories the observation is classified into.}

\item{X}{An N by P numeric matrix where N is the total number of
observations and P is the total number of predictor variables the ith row
gives the values of the predictor variables for the ith outcome observation.
The first column of X should be an intercept column of 1s.
Non-intercept X columns should be centered and scaled by their standard deviations for best results.}

\item{n_sample}{positive integer giving the number of samples to draw as
output after burn-in.}

\item{n_burn}{non-negative integer giving the number of samples of burn-in
before the chain output is saved.}

\item{n_sigma_check}{non-negative integer gives the period for the number of
samples on which to automatically tune the step size of the random walk.}

\item{prior}{character with either values "flat" or "normal"}

\item{prior_mean}{a vector of length equal to P the number of predictors.
Giving the mean for the normal prior on the coefficient vector. Only use if
prior = "normal".}

\item{prior_var}{a P by P matrix giving the covariance matrix of the prior
coefficients. Note that covariance structure is assumed to be constant across
categories. Must be a positive semi-definite matrix. Only use with prior = 
"normal".}

\item{reference_cat}{Either NULL or an integer between 1 and C where C is
the total number of categories. If left NULL, coefficients for all
categories will be generated, leading to a loss of identifiability in the
coefficients. If an integer, all of the coefficents for that category will
be held constant at 0.}

\item{probs}{logical If TRUE, for each non-burn chain sample of coefficients
the categorical probabilities of each observation will be calculated and returned.}

\item{progress}{logical If TRUE, the function will report progress at each thousandth
iteration.}
}
\value{
List object containing posterior_coef, the chain of coefficient
values as an P by C by n_sample array. If probs are TRUE, it will also contain
posterior_prob a N by C by n_sample array containing the calculated probabilities of the observations
being classified into each of the C categories.
}
\description{
This function implements a data augmentation method for
multinomial logisitic regression using MCMC. The data augmentation method is
outlined in a paper by Jared D. Fisher and Kyle R. McEvoy titled
"Bayesian Multinomial Logistic Regression for Numerous Categories",
currently a work in progress. The sampler uses a Random-Walk Metropolis
algorithm for choosing proposals and acceptances.
