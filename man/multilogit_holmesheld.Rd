\usage{
multilogit_holmesheld(
  Y,
  X,
  v = diag(1, nrow = ncol(X)),
  n_sample = 1000L,
  n_burn = 200L,
  probs = TRUE,
  progress = TRUE,
  fast = FALSE
)
}
\arguments{
\item{Y}{An N by C numeric matrix where the ith row is a set of
indicators for observation i giving which
of the C categories the observation is classified into.}

\item{X}{An N by P numeric matrix where the ith row gives
the values of the predictor variables for the ith observation. The first column of X
should be an intercept column of 1s. Non-intercept X columns
should be centered and scaled by their standard deviations for best results.}

\item{v}{a P by P numeric matrix giving the covariance matrix of coefficients.
The function only accepts one matrix for all categories.}

\item{n_sample}{positive integer giving the number of samples to draw as
output after burn-in.}

\item{n_burn}{non-negative integer giving the number of samples of burn-in
before the chain output is saved.}

\item{probs}{logical If TRUE categorical probabilities will be calculated and returned for
non-burn samples.}

\item{progress}{logical If TRUE the function will report its progress each thousandth iteration.}

\item{fast}{logical If TRUE the wrapper function will call \code{multilogit_hh_inv_C} as opposed to 
\code{mulitlogit_holmesheld_C}. \code{multilogit_hh_inv_C} uses faster matrix inverse functions so is faster, 
but is more prone to errors due to numerical tolerance issues when inverting the matrices.}
}
\value{
List object containing posterior_coef, the chain of coefficient 
values as an P by C by n_sample array. If probs is set to TRUE, the 
posterior_prob a N by C by n_sample array containing the calculated 
probabilities of the N observations being classified into each of the C categories 
will also be returned.
}
\description{
This is an R wrapper to the C++ functions multilogit_holmesheld_C and multilogit_hh_inv_C.
This function implements the Holmes and Held method for
multinomial logistic regression described in their 2006 paper
'Bayesian auxiliary variable models for binary and multinomial regression'
in Bayesian Analysis. The C++ code was written by Kyle R. McEvoy using the pseudo-code in
this paper as a template.

\examples{
Y <- matrix(0, nrow = 150, ncol = 3)
Y <- sapply(c(1,2,3), function(x) Y[, x] <- as.numeric((as.numeric(iris$Species) == x) )) 
X <- cbind(1, iris[ , 1:4])
X <- as.matrix(X)
v <- diag(1, ncol(X))
out <- multilogit_holmesheld(Y, X, v, n_sample = 2000, n_burn = 1000)
