\title{Multinomial Logistic Regression using the Polya-Gamma Method}
\usage{
multilogit_PG(Y, X, n_sample = 1000L, n_burn = 200L)
}
\arguments{
\item{Y}{An N by C numeric matrix where the ith row is a set of
indicators for observation i of N giving which of the C categories the
observation is classified into.}

\item{X}{An N by P numeric matrix where the ith row gives
the values of the predictor variables for the ith outcome observation.}

\item{n_sample}{positive integer giving the number of samples to draw as
output after burn-in.}

\item{n_burn}{non-negative integer giving the number of samples of burn-in
before the chain output is saved.}
}
\value{
List object containing posterior_coef, the chain of coefficient
values as an P by C by n_sample array. And posterior_prob a N by C by
n_sample array containing the calculated probabilities of the observations
being classified into each of the C categories.
}
\description{
This is an R wrapper to the function multilogit_PG_C.
This function implements the Polya-Gamma method for
multinomial logistic regression. Rewritten for C++ by Jared Fisher
and Kyle McEvoy, but code originally written by Jesse Windle.
